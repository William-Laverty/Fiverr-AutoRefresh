# Fiverr Online 24/7

Are you constantly checking your Fiverr gig management page for new orders or messages, but frustrated with having to manually refresh the page every few minutes? Our simple JavaScript code automates the process for you, opening your gig management page in an iframe and automatically refreshing it at your desired interval. Say goodbye to tedious manual refreshing and hello to 24/7 productivity with our Fiverr Online 24/7 tool!

## Usage

To use this code, simply copy and paste it into your web browser console while on the Fiverr gig management page.

1. Copy the code in `Fiverr-Online.js` to your clipboard.
2. Go to your Fiverr seller dashboard.
3. Open the browser console (usually by pressing F12).

The code will create an iframe that loads your seller dashboard and reloads it at the specified interval. You can minimize the iframe by clicking the "Minimize" button. To restore the iframe, click the "Expand" button.

## Configuration

You can customize the interval and URL by changing the values in the first line of the code:
